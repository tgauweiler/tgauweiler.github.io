      <description>Introduction After the cat utterly destroyed her old cat tree it was time to build a new better one.
Building I found a suitable branch with a nice forking. First step was to remove all bark, which was very time consuming. After that i sanded the wood down to remove all hard edges and wiped it down with oil. Then i added a piece of wood as stand and we have our standing tree.</description>
