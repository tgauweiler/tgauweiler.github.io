      <description>Introduction To measure the room temperature with a PC an Arduino nano clone with a DS18B20 temperature was used.
Build For building i used a raster PCB, mostly because for 2 components to design and etch a PCB is pretty overkill. The DS18B20 is a one wire sensor and only needed one extra resistor.
Software The idea was to connect the sensor to a PC and use a simple python script to notify me over Slack if measured temperature gets to high.</description>

      <description>Introduction The ZeroBoy is an old GameBoy Classic case with a Raspberry Pi Zero W inside There are many special parts for building this kind of project. I bought a board for the buttons, battery, HD display with HDMI cable and glass, audio amplifier, speaker, printed holder for the boards, charging board and various buttons.
Build I used a case of a broken old GameBoy which was already pretty yellowed.</description>

      <description>Introduction I had the idea to switch a relay over wifi with an app on my smartphone. For this i needed some board with wifi support and at least one GPIO.
So i bought a ESP8266 board in the ESP-01 variant. Mostly because it was so cheap, ~1â‚¬. Then i noticed, that programming it, wasn&amp;rsquo;t working as intended, because the chip needs around 250mW 3.3V to get running and the usb to serial converter wasn&amp;rsquo;t providing that much power.</description>
