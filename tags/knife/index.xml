      <description>Introduction After seeing some cool stuff done with epoxy i wanted to do something wood and epoxy. A knife block sounded like a doable idea.
Building I found a damaged piece of wood and decided to close up the damaged parts with epoxy. The bottom part was really broken out, so i had to add some support wood to keep the epoxy inside.
After the epoxy was dry i sanded the piece down until it was smooth.</description>
