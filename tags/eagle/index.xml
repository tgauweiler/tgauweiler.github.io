      <description>Introduction I did buy a ESP8266 board in the variant ESP-01. Mostly because it was so cheap. Then i noticed that programming it wasn&amp;rsquo;t working as intended, because the chip needs around 250mW 3.3V to get running and the usb to serial converter isnt providing that much docu. So I build the given circuit on a breadboard to provide enough power.

      <description>Introduction So for my esp project i wanted to create my own PCB. Because ordering only one PCB is pretty expensive i decided to make my own with the toner transfer method described here. I dismantled my cheap Genie Laminator (TODO ADD PICTURES!) and found out that it uses two temperature resistors to control the heating of the rollers. A quick search on ebay turned up two replacements parts for 180°C and 200°C.</description>
