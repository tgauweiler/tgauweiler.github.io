      <description>Introduction I had the idea to switch a relay over wifi with an app on my smartphone. For this i needed some board with wifi support and at least one GPIO.
So i bought a ESP8266 board in the ESP-01 variant. Mostly because it was so cheap, ~1€. Then i noticed, that programming it, wasn&amp;rsquo;t working as intended, because the chip needs around 250mW 3.3V to get running and the usb to serial converter wasn&amp;rsquo;t providing that much power.</description>

      <description>Introduction So for my esp project i wanted to create my own PCB. Because ordering only one PCB is pretty expensive i decided to make my own with the toner transfer method described here. I dismantled my cheap Genie Laminator (TODO ADD PICTURES!) and found out that it uses two temperature resistors to control the heating of the rollers. A quick search on ebay turned up two replacements parts for 180°C and 200°C.</description>
