<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>After seeing some cool stuff done with epoxy i wanted to do something wood and epoxy.
A knife block sounded like a doable idea.</p>

<h2 id="building">Building</h2>

<p>I found a damaged piece of wood and decided to close up the damaged parts with epoxy.
The bottom part was really broken out, so i had to add some support wood to keep the epoxy inside.</p>

<p>After the epoxy was dry i sanded the piece down until it was smooth.
There were still some holes in it, which again got filled with epoxy.</p>

<img src="4.jpg" alt="block4" /></p>

<p>Finally all holes were gone and i got started to polishing the epoxy parts.</p>

<p>After some oil it looks really nice.</p>

<p>Then i added some neodym magnets to keep the knifes in place and some metal pieces to hang it on a wall.</p>

<p><img src="7.jpg" alt="block5" /></p>

<p>It holds! And takes some force to take it off again.</p>

<p><img src="8.jpg" alt="block5" /></p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Epoxy sticks to anything!! Wear gloves and make sure all holes are sealed before pouring..
Next time i will probably use no clear epoxy, since a light source is missing you can&rsquo;t really see the inside of the big crack.</p>
