    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.zeroboy.eu/">ZeroBoy</a> is an old GameBoy Classic case with a Raspberry Pi Zero W inside
There are many special parts for building this kind of project.
I bought a board for the buttons, battery, HD display with HDMI cable and glass, audio amplifier, speaker, printed holder for the boards,
charging board and various buttons.</p>
<h2 id="build">Build</h2>
<p>I used a case of a broken old GameBoy which was already pretty yellowed.
Used my Dremel to cut out some plastic to make everything fit inside.

<p>Next i used a hair bleach solution to make the case white again.
For that i wrapped the case with some solution in plastic and placed it in sunlight.

<p>After some sunlight it looked much better.

<p>Next all parts were fitted inside with hot glue and connected.

<p>The new extra shoulder buttons and the power button were connected.</p>

<p>The whole cabling was pretty messy and if i would do it again, i would use a special all in one PCB instead.

<p>Function test after finishing all the cables.

<p>Fitted the new display glass and played.

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In the end this was a more pricy project for around 250â‚¬ in parts.
Technically the soldering and cabling was not so hard, but also doesn&rsquo;t looks so good.
A HDMI port for connecting to a TV with bluetooth controllers would have been nice but was not doable.</p>
