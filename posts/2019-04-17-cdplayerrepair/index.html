<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The old ROTEL RCD-971 had the problem of not opening the disc tray anymore.
Because i could still hear the motor spinning inside, i suspected the belt transmission between motor and disk tray.</p>

<h2 id="opening-repair">Opening &amp; Repair</h2>

<p>Opening the case was straight forward.</p>

<ul>
<li>Remove the screws on the bottom and back of the case</li>
<li>Remove the magnetic disk locking plate</li>
<li>Eject the disk tray by spinning the black gear manually</li>
<li>Remove the faceplate at the front</li>
<li>Unscrew the cd player module from the case</li>
<li>Gently unplug all cables to it</li>
<li>Lift it up and pull it back gently out</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Remove the disk tray by ejecting it, remove the stopper at the end and push the two plastic lashes at each side to unlock it</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Remove the black cover over the gears by pushing the lash down and sliding the whole thing upwards</li>
</ul>

<p>The square belt was still in place, but because age became to lose to unlock the magnet disk holder.
The original replacement part is not available anymore and a comparable part from ebay would cost around 15€..
So i bought 86 different sized squared belts from ebay for 18€.
Based on measurements i found a squared 40mm to fit best.</p>

<p>Assembled everything again and it works like new again.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Disassembling was extremely easy! Older hardware is so much easier to service.
15€ for one belt is downright ridiculous, but i guess now i have enough belts for the next years.
Whole thing without getting a new belt took like 15 minutes.</p>
