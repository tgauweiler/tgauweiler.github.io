<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>After the cat utterly destroyed her old cat tree it was time to build a new better one.</p>

<h2 id="building">Building</h2>

<p>I found a suitable branch with a nice forking.
First step was to remove all bark, which was very time consuming.
After that i sanded the wood down to remove all hard edges and wiped it down with oil.
Then i added a piece of wood as stand and we have our standing tree.<br />

<p>Now it was time to add some sisal rope for scratching.<br />

<p>Next came two platforms to lie on and again some rope as climbing help.<br />

<p>Finally i could move it in place and had to again shorted it a bit to really fit under the ceiling and secured it with a wedge.<br />

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>It was a fun wood project.
Removing the bark was really time consuming without a proper tool.
The cat loves her new scratching post, but refuses to climb to the platforms..</p>
