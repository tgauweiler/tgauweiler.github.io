    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>After the winter our Kärcher wasn&rsquo;t working anymore.
Best guess was that not all water was drained and the cold damaged something.</p>

<li>Opening is straight forward.</li>
<li><strong>The motor screws also hold in the oil!</strong></li>

One compression cylinder did some damage on its plastic duct and damaged the seal around it.</p>
<p>Replacing it was straight forward, but it turns out the main problem was the the pressure line after the motor.</p>
<p><strong>Always test correctly first!</strong></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Accidentally draining the oil was a mess.
Testing everything first would have saved some delivery costs.
Disassembly was easy, its a straight forward design with only screws and the replacement parts are available by Kärcher for everything.</p>
