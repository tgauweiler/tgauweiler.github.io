<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>I found one of my old Lego Technic cable.
The cable isolation aged not so well and basically disintegrated in my hand.

<p>With a little help from Google, I found out that &ldquo;Zwillingslitze 2x0,14mm² einfarbig schwarz&rdquo; is an adequate cable replacement.
5 meters cost me, with delivery, around 5€.</p>

<h2 id="opening-repair">Opening &amp; Repair</h2>

<p>The new cable is a little bit thinner then the original one, but still looks good enough.</p>

<p>Opening the ends can be done with a small flat screwdriver to unlock two lashes on one side.
It is easier to open the side were the cable enters.</p>

<p>Then cutting a piece of the new cable in length of the old one.
The teeth inside the ends cut through the isolation when its closed.
I did a fast resistance test with my multimeter to ensure everything is connected as expected.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Opening the ends was easier than expected.
The 5 meters of new cable should be enough to fix a bunch of these in the future.
Replacing the cable took about 10 minutes and it works as good as new.</p>
