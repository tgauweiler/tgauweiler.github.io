<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>An old mercedes key refused to open the car and the litte led wouldn&rsquo;t blink.</p>

<h2 id="replacement">Replacement</h2>

<p>The first step was to replace the batteries and test again.</p>

<p>This didn&rsquo;t help, so the next step was to remove the PCB board.</p>

<p>The board came out with two loose parts (bad) and a broken plastic spacer (not so bad).</p>

<p>The parts (one button, one signal modulation component?) did fall off.</p>

<p>The bottom of the PCB did look normal, last time the little spule and the IR component broke off.</p>

<p><img src="5.jpg" alt="PCB bottom" /></p>

<p>Soldered the parts back in and added some glue for good measure.</p>

<p><img src="6.jpg" alt="Finished" /></p>

<p>Tested and works reliably again.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>~15min of work, but i already opened these keys often.
The broken plastic was unfortunate, but the key is pretty old already.
Was pretty worth it, a new key costs around ~100â‚¬ with programming from the dealer.</p>
