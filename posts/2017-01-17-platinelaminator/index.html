<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>So for my <a href="https://tgauweiler.github.io/posts/2017-02-03-espboard/">esp project</a> i wanted to create my own PCB.
Because ordering only one PCB is pretty expensive i decided to make my own with the toner transfer method described <a href="http://thomaspfeifer.net/platinen_aetzen.htm">here</a>.
I dismantled my cheap Genie Laminator (TODO ADD PICTURES!) and found out that it uses two temperature resistors to control the heating of the rollers.
A quick search on ebay turned up two replacements parts for 180°C and 200°C.
Turns out 180°C is already enough to get a nice transfer of the toner to the PCB.<br />

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The resulting machine is neither pretty nor in any way safe (electrical and fire hazard), but it gets the job done.
It was easier than i expected to turn up the heat.
A safer and nicer case would be nice, but some people already pointed out the life time is probably not so long, because the rollers can&rsquo;t handle the extra heat and the extra mechanical stress of thicker PCBs for long.</p>
