      <description>Introduction After the cat utterly destroyed her old cat tree it was time to build a new better one.
Building I found a suitable branch with a nice forking. First step was to remove all bark, which was very time consuming. After that i sanded the wood down to remove all hard edges and wiped it down with oil. Then i added a piece of wood as stand and we have our standing tree.</description>

      <description>Introduction After seeing some cool stuff done with epoxy i wanted to do something wood and epoxy. A knife block sounded like a doable idea.
Building I found a damaged piece of wood and decided to close up the damaged parts with epoxy. The bottom part was really broken out, so i had to add some support wood to keep the epoxy inside.
After the epoxy was dry i sanded the piece down until it was smooth.</description>

      <description>Introduction I did buy a ESP8266 board in the variant ESP-01. Mostly because it was so cheap. Then i noticed that programming it wasn&amp;rsquo;t working as intended, because the chip needs around 250mW 3.3V to get running and the usb to serial converter isnt providing that much docu. So I build the given circuit on a breadboard to provide enough power.
Design own platine with Eagle But since that was pretty ugly I decided to build my own platine for it with eagle.</description>

      <title>Toner transfer method for PCBs</title>

      <description>Introduction So for my esp project i wanted to create my own PCB. Because ordering only one PCB is pretty expensive i decided to make my own with the toner transfer method described here. I dismantled my cheap Genie Laminator (TODO ADD PICTURES!) and found out that it uses two temperature resistors to control the heating of the rollers. A quick search on ebay turned up two replacements parts for 180°C and 200°C.</description>
