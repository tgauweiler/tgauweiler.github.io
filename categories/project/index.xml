      <title>Mercedes key repair</title>

      <description>Introduction An old mercedes key refused to open the car and the litte led wouldn&amp;rsquo;t blink.
Replacement The first step was to replace the batteries and test again.
This didn&amp;rsquo;t help, so the next step was to remove the PCB board.
The board came out with two loose parts (bad) and a broken plastic spacer (not so bad).
The parts (one button, one signal modulation component?) did fall off.</description>

      <title>MacBook Air power supply</title>

      <description>Introduction My macbook power supply cable got the typical apple problem and cracked open at the connector.
For a long time I helped myself with some electronic tape, but after my macbook did some strange sounds, depending on how the cable was lying, it was time to replace it.
Replacement Because I only heard negative things about knockoff power supplies, I decided to fix my original one. For this I ordered a fitting replacement cable for ~12€.</description>

      <title>Kitchen Scale Battery Upgrade</title>

      <description>Introduction The kitchen scale ate batteries up in no time and these button style ones are pretty pricy. Also if the batteries get low, the scale can&amp;rsquo;t measure heavier stuff and just throws an error. So I opened it up and noticed that both batteries are wired in parallel and are providing 3V. This lead me to the plan, to replace both with two 1.5V AA batteries wired in series.</description>

      <title>USB Temperature Sensor</title>

      <description>Introduction To measure the room temperature with a PC an Arduino nano clone with a DS18B20 temperature was used.
Build For building i used a raster PCB, mostly because for 2 components to design and etch a PCB is pretty overkill. The DS18B20 is a one wire sensor and only needed one extra resistor.
Software The idea was to connect the sensor to a PC and use a simple python script to notify me over Slack if the measured temperature gets to high or to low.</description>

      <description>Introduction The ZeroBoy is an old GameBoy Classic case with a Raspberry Pi Zero W inside There are many special parts for building this kind of project. I bought a board for the buttons, battery, HD display with HDMI cable and glass, audio amplifier, speaker, printed holder for the boards, charging board and various buttons.
Build I used a case of a broken old GameBoy which was already pretty yellowed.</description>

      <description>Introduction After the cat utterly destroyed her old cat tree it was time to build a new better one.
Building I found a suitable branch with a nice forking. First step was to remove all bark, which was very time consuming. After that i sanded the wood down to remove all hard edges and wiped it down with oil. Then i added a piece of wood as stand and we have our standing tree.</description>

      <description>Introduction After seeing some cool stuff done with epoxy i wanted to do something wood and epoxy. A knife block sounded like a doable idea.
Building I found a damaged piece of wood and decided to close up the damaged parts with epoxy. The bottom part was really broken out, so i had to add some support wood to keep the epoxy inside.
After the epoxy was dry i sanded the piece down until it was smooth.</description>

      <description>Introduction I had the idea to switch a relay over wifi with an app on my smartphone. For this i needed some board with wifi support and at least one GPIO.
So i bought a ESP8266 board in the ESP-01 variant. Mostly because it was so cheap, ~1€. Then i noticed, that programming it, wasn&amp;rsquo;t working as intended, because the chip needs around 250mW 3.3V to get running and the usb to serial converter wasn&amp;rsquo;t providing that much power.</description>

      <title>Toner transfer method for PCBs</title>
      <link>https://tgauweiler.github.io/posts/2017-01-17-platinelaminator/</link>

      <description>Introduction So for my esp project i wanted to create my own PCB. Because ordering only one PCB is pretty expensive i decided to make my own with the toner transfer method described here. I dismantled my cheap Genie Laminator (TODO ADD PICTURES!) and found out that it uses two temperature resistors to control the heating of the rollers. A quick search on ebay turned up two replacements parts for 180°C and 200°C.</description>
